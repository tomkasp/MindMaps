This year is very important for Tomasz and the project he is involved in - InfoNAV. With multiple new implementations and features requests, it's easy to say that there is a lot of going on for Tomasz this year. Fortunately, in the first quarter of the year, he proves his professionalism. 

I received very positive feedback from Tomasz's co-workers about his attitude and quality of work. He was mentoring younger colleagues, delivering new functionality with high quality. In addition, he was involved in the performance tuning of the app which is critical for the InfoNAV. 

During difficult times of pandemic, we all need to adjust to the new reality. Tomasz with his positive approach to life and work creates a friendly environment for everyone he works with.
